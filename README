Public Sector Credit Framework (PSCF)

PSCF is a tool that allows you to assess sovereign and sub-sovereign credit by running a multi-period budget simulation. The system computes annual default probabilities by determining the proportion of simulation trials that surpass a user defined fiscal threshold. 

PSCF is provided under the GNU Lesser Public License.

To use PSCF with Microsoft Excel, you enter information into two worksheets: series and models. Once data entry is complete, you click the PSCF Control Panel and then Run Analysis to perform the budget simulation. The simulation procedure converts the workbook data into a C program, and then compiles and runs this program. Simulation outputs are then returned to the Excel workbook.

Although the user interface is based on Windows and Excel, the template generation routine is written in ANSI C++ and compiled with the GNU C++ compiler. It is thus portable. Specifically, the core is known to work on Linux.

The installation downloads and installs the GNU Compiler and the Boost library. If you already have either of these, their operation could be affected by this installation.

The installation does not create an icon or start menu item. To use PSCF, please open Excel and load //My Documents/PSCF/Sample.xlsm. Please make sure to Enable Excel Macros. Also, if you receive an error when running analysis on the first attempt, please close and reopen Excel and reload Sample.xlsm.  The sample workbook includes a tab entitled "documentation" which explains how to populate each field in the workbook.
